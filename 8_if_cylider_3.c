/*
write a program to findout which cylinder is bigger from two cylinder's radius and height given by user.
steps
1 = creat variables
2 = tack value from user and store it in variables.
3 = creat logic for calculation all  cylinders surfase area.
    A=2πrh+2πr2
4 = display which cylinder is big and small.
5 = diplay thank you for visit
